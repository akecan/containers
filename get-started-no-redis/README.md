# Docker Container:  Get Started without Redis

This folder is a docker file with a few artefacts defining a Docker Image corresponding to [Docker's getting started part 2](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/part2/).

We removed the Redis invocation which created (on purpose in the tutorial) an error and increased latency.
